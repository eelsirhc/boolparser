{"name":"Boolparser","tagline":"Simple Python module to parse (a==b)&(c>1)|(d==0)&((e<=1)&!f)","body":"boolparser\r\n\r\nThis package defines a simple boolean parser using PyParsing that allows user defined variables and floating point numbers to be used in a nested boolean comparison. For example, if the variables `a`,`b`, and `c` are defined then the following string can be parsed\r\n\r\n    (a==1 & b<2) | c>4\r\n\r\nThe resolution of `a`, `b`, and `c` is left up to the user by inheriting from the class `EvaluateVariable` class and overriding the `eval` function. This allows the variables to be references to (say) data stored in a file.\r\n\r\nBSD licensed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
